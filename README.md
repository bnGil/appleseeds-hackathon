# Appleseeds Hackathon

## Description

We built this website during the bootcamp's Hackathon. The main goal was to make a certain subject accessible to people who speak different languages.

The website displays various attractions and famous sites around the world and enables users to learn about these places.
Another feature is a quiz, that displays one site each time with 4 possible answers, one of them is correct.

Use this website to pick your next travel destination!
